# AIG Virtual Internship - Cybersecurity

This repository contains my solutions for the **AIG Virtual Internship** on Forage, focusing on cybersecurity challenges.

Tasks include:
- Responding to a **zero-day vulnerability** by researching and drafting an alert email.
- Writing a **Python script** to bruteforce the decryption key of an encrypted file to bypass ransomware.

This project is for **educational purposes only** and aims to demonstrate cybersecurity problem-solving skills.
