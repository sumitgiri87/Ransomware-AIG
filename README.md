# AIG Virtual Internship - Cybersecurity

This repository contains my solutions for the **AIG Virtual Internship** on Forage, focusing on cybersecurity challenges.

Tasks include:
- Responding to a **zero-day vulnerability** by researching and drafting an alert email.
- Writing a **Python script** to bruteforce the decryption key of an encrypted file to bypass ransomware.

This project is for **educational purposes only** and aims to demonstrate cybersecurity problem-solving skills.

## Task 1: Responding to a Zero-Day Vulnerability
The **Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)** has recently published advisories regarding:
- A critical vulnerability in **[Apache Log4j](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa21-356a)**, widely used logging software.
- The increasing professionalization of **ransomware attacks**, posing risks to enterprises like AIG.

### Task Overview
- Research the **Log4j zero-day vulnerability** using CISA advisories.
- Analyze affected infrastructure and determine the responsible teams.
- Draft an advisory email to alert relevant teams and provide remediation steps.
